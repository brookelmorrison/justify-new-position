# Request to Justify New Position
Data and information to justify new assistant

This repository contains data used to justify a request to hire a new Assistant State's Attorney and a draft request. The State's Attorney (also known as District Attorney in other states) requested an analysis of workload of his and other comparable counties within the judicial circuit and a report to present evidence to show that the legal workload for the county necessitated more staff. 

All data are public record from the Illinois State Policy and the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority. Other information used in the request, such as challenges and measures already taken were made from interviews from the State's Attorney. Some information has been redacted to protect confidentiality.

Disclaimer: This request and data should not be used as part of any criminal justice studies, as it is only an example of work completed. The request is a draft version and is not the final request.
